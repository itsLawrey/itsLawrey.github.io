# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, please use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button under the **Security** tab of this repository. This allows you to message the maintainer privately and securely.

If the private reporting feature is unavailable, please contact the maintainer through the social links or email listed on the [itsLawrey GitHub Profile](https://github.com/itsLawrey).
